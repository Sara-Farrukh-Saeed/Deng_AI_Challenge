# Deng_AI_Challenge

- Challenge Site: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/44/dengai-predicting-disease-spread/page/80/

## Background:
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. 
Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. 

## Challenge:
Our goal is to predict the total_cases label for each (city, year, weekofyear) in the test set. 
There are two cities, San Juan and Iquitos, with test data for each city spanning 5 and 3 years respectively.
